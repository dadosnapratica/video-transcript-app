## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Before you begin, ensure that Python 3.10 is installed on your system. Additionally, you will need FFmpeg for video and audio processing.

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- ffmpeg installed on the system.
- Create Google API Key for free use of YouTube Data API
- Write permission for ./data path
- Install Dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

#### 1. **Install Python 3.10**

##### Windows and macOS

Download and install Python 3.10 from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/). Be sure to check the option "Add Python 3.10 to PATH" during installation on Windows.

##### Linux

Use the package manager to install Python 3.10 on Ubuntu. For example, on Ubuntu, run:

##### Install Pre-reqs and Update APT

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
```

##### Add custom APT repository

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
```

##### Install Python

```bash
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev
python3 --version
```

##### Check installed version

```bash
python3 --version
```

#### MacOS

```bash
   brew install python@3.10
```

#### 2. **Configure ffmpeg**

##### Check if ffmpeg is installed

```bash
ffmepg --version
```

##### On Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

##### On MacOS

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

##### On Windows

###### Download FFmpeg

- Go to the official FFmpeg website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html. 
- Under "Get packages & executable files", select "Windows" and choose the latest "Windows - Builds by BtbN" option.
- Download the appropriate zip file for your system. 

###### Extract the files

- Locate the downloaded zip file. 
- Right-click on it and select "Extract All". 
- Choose a destination folder, ideally creating a new folder named "FFmpeg" on your C drive.

** Ensure ffmpeg is installed and available in the `PATH`.

#### 3. **Configure YouTube API Credentials**:

- Create a project on the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com/.
- Enable the YouTube Data API v3 by navigating to "APIs & Services" > "Library", search for "YouTube Data API v3" and enable it.
- Create credentials (API Key) by going to "Credentials", click on "Create Credentials", and select "API key".
- Restrict the key to specific APIs (YouTube Data API v3).
- Create an .env file at the root of your project and add the key as follows

```envfile
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

#### 4. **Install Dependencies**:

   In the project's root directory, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üì¶ How to Use

1. **Run Locally**:
   Start the application with the command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Application Workflow**:
   - Enter the YouTube video ID or URL.
   - Click **Transcribe Video** to generate subtitles.

   ** There are Language dropdowns for future translate feature

3. **Generated Files**:
   - `.vtt` files will be saved in the `data/output/` directory.

4. **VTT content are avaliabel in a text area**

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Modular Architecture

### Application Layers

- **Presentation Layer**

   #### **`app.py`**

   - Manages the Streamlit interface and interacts with the `backend.py` and `utils.py` modules.

- **Backend Layer**, for interact with external services, eg. language table

   #### **`backend.py`**

   - Implements the main functions for YouTube API integration and transcription.

   #### **`utils.py`**

   - Provides helper functions like URL validation and ffmpeg location.

   #### **`YouTubeTranscriber.py`**

   - Main class for downloading, splitting, and transcribing audio.
